# Portfolio-Management

This project focuses on portfolio management using zapper's API. This project is meant to monitor wallet balances, and assessing token values for effective portfolio management.

## Use Cases
- Monitor Wallet Balances and Net Worth: Tracks the balances across multiple wallets for a consolidated view of total assets.
- Token Price Tracking: Retrieves and updates the prices of tokens within tracked wallets.
- Gas Price Monitoring: Provides up-to-date gas prices to help users optimize transaction timing.

## API Integration Strategy
Once the Zapper API key is available, data retrieval functions will be fully implemented to support these features. This integration will drive real-time updates, allowing for continuous, accurate portfolio assessment.

## Project Objectives
- Comprehensive Wallet Monitoring: Develop functionalities to seamlessly track wallet assets.
- Scalability: Expand the tool to support NFTs, cross-chain balances, and other DeFi applications as needed.

## Future Development
Post-integration, enhancements will focus on visual analytics and additional support for diversified crypto assets, creating a robust tool for financial management within the crypto ecosystem.
